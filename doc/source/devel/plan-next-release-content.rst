Plan next release content
=========================

1. Ensure a milestone ``X.Y.Z`` exists for the upcoming release.

2. Create an issue for each feature request.

3. During a :ref:`Technical Steering Committee (TSC) meeting
   <organize-tsc-meeting>`, present the proposed list of feature requests for
   the next release.

   * Discuss the proposal with the TSC and meeting participants.
   * The TSC validates and finalizes the feature list for the upcoming version.

4. Assign the release milestone to all selected feature issues.

5. Once the initial feature scope is defined, estimate a target due date
   (with quarter-level precision).

   * Set the estimated due date in the GitHub milestone properties.

6. Review the feature list at every TSC meeting.

   * Depending on project status and scheduling constraints, the TSC may
     add or remove items from the release scope.

7. Maintainers should prioritize relevant external contributions that can
   be included in the upcoming release.
